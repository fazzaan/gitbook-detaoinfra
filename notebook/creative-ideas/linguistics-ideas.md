# Linguistics ideas

_A bunch of my ideas for creating, mutating and otherwise modifying languages._

<details>

<summary>A <strong>script style</strong> designed with <strong>diacritics</strong> as first-class citizens <em>(NewEng)</em> </summary>

A better font-script style&#x20;

* to accommodate lots of diacritics&#x20;
* to make them part of the script rather than looking like uncomfortable addons.

This idea stems from [NewEng](https://app.gitbook.com/o/bhv2aXe6eExkCxRzuAVK/s/nQuhfcBU5w4vA1rwurTv/) and Devanagari.

It can be useful for **NewEng** and **Vietnamese**. The modern Vietnamese script is around 400 years old already, but the stacking of all the diacritics still looks a bit uncomfortable.&#x20;

<summary>Modern Liturgical English</summary>

Creating a liturgical branch of English, perhaps with simplified pronunciation, featuring only consonant–vowel and consonant–vowel–sonorant syllables. Only strong vowels and diphthongs (and schwa?) are allowed.

Attempt to enforce rhythmic syllables in oration.

Allowable syllable structures:

* V&#x20;
* CV&#x20;
* CVS&#x20;
* CVV&#x20;
* CVVS

This mirrors the traditional liturgical speech heard in other languages, such as Sanskrit.

Example:&#x20;

"I **surrender** to **the** destroyer **of** obstacles." ↓&#x20;

"I **su-ren-da** tu **ðə** di-sa-troy-ya **o-va** o-ba-sta-cəl-za."
