## Ο Ωκεανός — The Ocean

Lift, push; fall, pull\
down, back; under it all\
Power, destroyer, all into dust\
highest when the Moon is full.

Take me, break me\
crash but not smash -\
compared to High Seas\
a beach is a splash…

Still, the power within it,\
a life it can take\
Attention you must pay\
or soon you will make,

the mistake of "too far"\
past the sandy drop-off:\
returning from there\
is increasingly tough

Greater depth for the wave\
a travelling spiral\
as a leaf in a hurricane\
undertowed by the swell.

Struggle! Lose air,\
which way to aim for?\
Or surrender, find peace\
& she'll bring you ashore

Relinquish control,\
shape only your self-command;\
look within, look without\
& you'll soon understand:

You cannot control the Ocean.\
Learn to use elemental power by understanding how to ride it.
