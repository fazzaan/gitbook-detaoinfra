Mind is lost\
Distracted, confused\
Wondering, wandering\
Time for something new

Next place; move along\
Seen enough, not what I expected\
Forgotten enjoymentâ€”\
too long I neglected

World is good enough!\
Learn from it all\
Filter your perception,\
and you won't see in full.

Tension grows, nothing flows\
Feelings lost, gathering moss\
Seeking clarity without accepting Reality.

Acknowledge the Source, let it take you on a course\
Through vibratory states, micro place-to-place\
Relax into the ride, in & out like a tide.\
Always a-changing, evaporation & raining\
Spiralling, discovering, no way to repeat:\
Who do you do this for? Time to find your feet!

In: expand awareness;\
Hold: larger than your Self is;\
Out: retract, compress;\
Condense a ball of stillness.

Intuition blockage in my Body manifest\
Messenger of the Vital realm indicating stress\
Understand that, to adapt, I must take time to rest.\
Come into phase, this is not a race nor test.

You have all the Time in the World.\
Breathe.
