**«** _stage 1_ **»**

There is a boy, stuck in Ha Noi,\
What does he need to do?\
Pull out his finger! No more can he linger\
Earning dollah soon must ensue.

Something’s holding him back; Self-inflicted attack,\
A perpetual uncertainty state —\
Recalled from a past dream, events are not as they seem\
Dissociate from Self, ride awake!

In victimhood, hiding; but it’s no place for residing\
To cause effect there must be action!\
He knows steps to take, & the shapes he must make to\
Resolve this to satisfaction.

Look from with-out; know what you’re about,\
You are carving a path through Infinity.\
Create harmony, resonance — abandon all decadence,\
Recognise eternal divinity.

Tarot card of the day, drawn after writing the poem:

{The Devil, reversed}

“The shadows of co-dependency, enslavement and debt are being cleared, and an understanding of what is important and what isn’t is once again achieved. What are the things you need to do in order to completely free yourself from your chains?”

_\~ Golden Thread Digital Tarot Deck_

This is a way in which Tarot can actually help you. Yes, the things you read can "seem to apply to yourself because they could apply to anyone" — does it even matter if that means it's fake or real? Because indeed if it "applies" to you then it is helping you see within, look within, introspect.

_**That's the point.**_
