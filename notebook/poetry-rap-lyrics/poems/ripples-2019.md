Watching the surface\
of a quiet, still pool\
of water, in the mountains of Lao,\
A pondskater, dancing\
around on the pool;\
a fish mouth gasps up at it, now.\
Caught it, or not\
‚ÄîI cannot tell‚Äî\
but the process creates a sound!\
I‚Äôm so close: sound and light\
appear synchronised\
and the ripple on the water spreads out.

Hypothetically, it comes\
in imaginal sums\
rendered through my perceptual filters:\
"Should there only be water\
and air, then wind ought'a\
be created by fish-ripple forces!"\
A relation exists\
between sound and the fish:\
Air & Water moved by the same "plop".\
Each ripple's unique\
from up on its first peak\
to the end of its very last drop.\
Compressed to a plane,\
interpolation's impossible\
to find the initial event.\
The sheer complexity\
of information necessary\
shows the amount of variation potential;\
And to find the true origin\
of All, with precision\
cannot be understood scientifical.

\[Science seeks by dividing\
and trying to find in\
the particle, proof that it's spherical.\
Pi œÄ times diameter\
is the circle's perimeter:\
a value certainly irrational.\
Can't be defined,\
we can't comprehend it,\
but it's there when you look at it Whole.]

Of All, we are part:\
there is no separation,\
every movement is causing displacement.\
As we move faster,\
more turbulence created;\
the greater the swell of the Ocean.\
It can happen to trees,\
animals and the bees,\
and manifest in your emotion.\
When creating a space,\
it always must be filled,\
great change causing great motion.\
Examples: combustion;\
traffic; eruption;\
confusion, extraction, explosion.

At the crux‚Äîand the edge‚Äî\
the goal is the same:\
"By all means Balance shall be found."\
All actions have\
their equal & opposite\
bass-ic law eternally resound!\
Forces of Nature\
we perceive as violent\
are actually systemic; reflexive.\
Consider a lifeform,\
before you now:\
treat them as less than angelic.\
Their physical form\
reacts to invasion,\
immuno; hormonal; electric.

Perceive separation,\
personification,\
treat Lady Gaia the best.\
Your Mother, & Earth,\
both Goddess forces,\
from antics ours need to have rest.\
Imagine some butterflies\
creating a hurricane,\
moving wings in a unified sweep.\
How are your frequencies?,\
with what do you resonate?\
See, the ripples surrounding your feet!

Live harm-reduction\
Quicksilver momental,\
Middle-Path, In-Between, Elemental.
