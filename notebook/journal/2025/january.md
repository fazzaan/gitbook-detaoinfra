### Primel Metrology — Dozenal, Base 12, Coherent Metric

[🌐🔗Introduction to Primel Metrology](https://primelmetrology.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/35565/Introduction+to+the+Primel+Metrology)

we don't actually have to do what "everyone else" is doing... there are different, and often better, ways.

in 1443, King Sejong 세종대왕 introduced Han-geul, to replace Idu (Hanja, chinese hanzi characters), because the vast majority of Koreans were illiterate. Hangeul was decried by the rich & educated literati class, and (after a variety of other events, including foreign occupation) Hangeul did not come into widespread usage until 1945.

In 1945, the literacy rate was as low as 22%. But by 1958, the national literacy rate reached 95.9%. Today it is practically 100%.

Han-geul existed for 500 years before widespread adoption, but as soon as it was given the chance, it had exactly the intended effect — increasing the national literacy rate of the general populus, the common folk, to almost 100%.

_**Imagine the same but for mathematics.**_

We don't actually have to do what "everyone else" is doing...

there are different, and often better, ways

e.g. base 10 numeration is rather stupid. Base 10 only divides by 2 and 5...

If you like the idea of everyone being able to do simple, quick, mental maths, with factors of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48... then, Read [this link](https://primelmetrology.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/35565/Introduction+to+the+Primel+Metrology) about base 12 maths and all the emergent metrological units

**start using what you think & feel is better and more (positively) progressive**

<mark style="color:blue;">**things in this life**</mark> don't just change of their own accord. they <mark style="color:green;">**change because people start doing things in a new (or old) way**</mark>.

<mark style="color:red;">so if we all just keep doing "what everyone else is doing", we're gonna stagnate.</mark>

Popular culture is not the friend of living culture.
