_My comment:_

afai can tell, visualisation method (magnetising the future you intend) may work through the same mechanism. By clearly visualising the future that you want (for want of a better word) you focus on a specific array of outcomes and then gaze through time to reach it. I have and do use visualisation in a variety of forms fairly often, and regularly achieve success through it.

I've avoided chaos magick, it always felt kind of rude to the Universe, like shaking people's trousers as they walk by and grabbing any coins that fall out.

what you describe in this video makes a lot of sense to me. I think I've thought along these lines many times, through many trips, both molecularly assisted and non. Long motorbike drives, willing butterflies loitering above the road to avoid my approaching helmet, and them dodging an unreasonable number of times. Made me focus very much on retrocausality and plumbing the mental realm to determine if it could work. This, of course, coming after copious experiences of synchronicity and real-time contemplation of real-time and time; and also a lot of work on utilizing the senses to perceive through time. I've scrolled through near-future events inside a glass ball at a house party, saw a fight starting between a group of best friends, so I went to hide outside in the garden and soon heard shouting and large objects being thrown. I say "scrolled" because it really was like rolling a glassy trackball to scrub forwards and backwards through a 4D video.

other keywords which link your video & info to my past experiences and similar ideas:\
drishti,\
dzogchen,\
qi gong,\
k (as a hacky access node) (may be akin to crowley's concept of using a specific low quantity of pure alcohol to lubricate the frictious bondage of the ego over the anima),\
and also archery,\
along with flow arts\
and I guess all of the arts, as channels of expression of the soul & spirit.

By focussing on a point (or array, or on All) past the local point of interaction, the output of your action draws something from a point/place/array that is unseen by others.\
This is (i think) what makes certain creations "deep", more breathtaking, more wondrous, awe-inspiring -- because they contain a projection from something beyond this physical present moment and past memorial moments.\
This is also (I think) the key to being able to do basically any task, skill, art, job that you want or need to do -- focus deeper & further than the activity that you are engaging in.

My experiences with qi gong and other energetic movement art seems to align with this too: the focus is on something _beyond_ the body and physical movements, and thus you are able to interact with it. In qi gong, in fluid dance, contact dance, trance dancefloor events, I -- we: myself and groups of friends & strangers -- find ourself vibrating into a magnetic-like field, as if moving in an ocean, feeling a field of energy around and through us, holding us as we move. We feel each other around us, we move in synchrony, we balance and flow in synergy and coherence. These environments are the highest sense of real-time magic I've experienced, and I think it is, again, because we are focussed on doing something that is beyond the immediate point of now. We are in the Now and therefore can engage with the future. Now I'm doing the thing you said, trying to explain synchronicity; I hope that it lands.

\[\[ As an aside: This is also (I think) perhaps one of the qualities that is lacking in \*\*-generated outputs (image, text, etc) -- such models are trained on the past, not on the future, and as such are essentially generating output inside a black hole, I always imagine the dark twisty ends of fractal corridors once you've reached such a depth that you are truly beyond the rendering capabilities of the Universe. There may well be a correlation between people who don't know how to operate in this modality and people who can't see anything wrong/weird/sinister in \*\*-generated outputs. (To note: I am not against \*\* per se but I do not believe that we have yet reached even a legitimate semblance of \*\* (at least, in the public sphere).) ]]
