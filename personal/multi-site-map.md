# Multi-site Map

This is a mindmap vector image, hosted on Figma. Sometimes it loads a bit slowly! GitBook doesn't have a feature that makes it easy to visualize page hierarchy or other relationships, so I've resorted to this for now.

The embedded view has regular mouse interaction.

Zoom by pinching on a touchpad or Ctrl+Scrolling with a mouse.

Click on the titles to visit that website! (Hopefully you can use Ctrl+Click or Middle Click to open them in new tabs.)
