## Criteria for game preference

Any game that does not fulfill these criteria is invalid.

1. Non-infinite
2. Not designed around addiction
3. Good story or no story

### 1. Non-infinite

This is a non-negotiable criterion. Infinite environments and exponential growth challenge result in black hole games, i.e. they will be a time sink.&#x20;

### 2. Not designed around addiction

This is perhaps evil incarnate.

### 3. Good story or no story

A poor storyline is a waste of time. Give me a good story that I can enjoy and learn from, or give me a game that doesn't try to tell a story.
