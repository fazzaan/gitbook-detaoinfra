# Music

{% hint style="info" %}
My default music selection is lyricless. Most is also wordless, because words distract my attention when I am doing anything to the music, such as dancing, flowing, working or creating. This is not about having a weak mind, but rather about crafting the ideal environment that is conducive to optimal performance in whatever I am doing.
{% endhint %}

I can't really describe the music that I like.

I suppose you're not supposed to describe music anyway so that's fine.

Here's some music that I like.

Some kind of order will emerge over time, I'm sure.

## Psytrance

_Psytrance, but I have requirements for what makes it good and transcendent._&#x20;
