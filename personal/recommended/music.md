# Music

{% hint style="info" %}
My default music selection is lyricless. Most is also wordless, because words distract my attention when I am doing anything to the music, such as dancing, flowing, working or creating. This is not about having a weak mind, but rather about crafting the ideal environment that is conducive to optimal performance in whatever I am doing.
