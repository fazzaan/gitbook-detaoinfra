# Music

{% hint style="info" %}
My default music selection is lyricless. Most is also wordless, because words distract my attention when I am doing anything to the music, such as dancing, flowing, working or creating. This is not about having a weak mind, but rather about crafting the ideal environment that is conducive to optimal performance in whatever I am doing.
{% endhint %}

I can't really describe the music that I like.

I suppose you're not supposed to describe music anyway so that's fine.

Here's some music that I like.

Some kind of order will emerge over time, I'm sure.

## Psy-midtempo

I don't know a genre name for this class but basically it's like psytrance, it's psychedelic but slower, the beat & pace feel grounded and stable, the music varies progressively, and the structure is deeply entrancing.

## Psy Dirge

I honestly have no idea if there's a proper name for this genre.

There's a quality to the soundscape that creates an all-consuming soundzone with a slight dischordance that seems to hold you in it. It typically goes well with specific chemicals.
