# Support Me

You can support me financially and by spreading my information.

My work is focussed on research & development for the ecosystem, life, and the planet overall, and also on privacy, security, safe communication channels, and infrastructure allowing each & all of us to retain freedom and defend the planet & communities in the present & the future.

## Send me money

Send me money to support me financially in the work I'm doing for the planetary ecosystem.

I'm also doing other things, like writing educational materials for students learning English, but unfortunately my methods do not align with the popularist mainstream education system so most students do not feel comfortable risking spending money on methods that they don't know about. The country & culture that I'm living in is very "normalised", in that most of them like to follow the mainstream and do what is normal, typical and expected. I have solutions for them in English education but the only way I can disseminate it is to give it away for free.

## Spread my information

Only recently, I started writing all my information online. I've been posting on social media a lot but, if you've noticed, a) it is all algorithmised and moderated/policed by robots, and b) it is inherently unsortable and unsearchable, you cannot create any order, categorisation, hierarchy or othersuch system of organising your information. Posts are chronological (or not!) and that's it.

I started imagining how to organise all my ideas, projects, plans, portfolio, research, etc, and I came to the conclusion that I was looking for a wiki website platform.

I couldn't find something that easily matched my requirements & desires, but a friend pointed me in the direction of GitBook and, well, here we are.&#x20;

I've verily & absolutely accidentally built an entire battalion of websites with sub-sites and pages and sub-pages galore! Check the [#quick-access-multi-site-map](./#quick-access-multi-site-map "mention") section to see all the sites.&#x20;
