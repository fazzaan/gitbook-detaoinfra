BlockTrain typeface designs for a client creating a 3D computer game. I designed a formal, block-based typeface, and derived a naturalised handwritten style, and I digitized both into two separate fonts with full feature parity, floating diacritics, and common symbols & punctuation.

Here is the review from my happy client:
