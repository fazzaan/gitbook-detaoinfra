### BlockTrain typeface

BlockTrain typeface designs for a client creating a 3D computer game. I designed a formal, block-based typeface, and derived a naturalised handwritten style, and I digitized both into two separate fonts with full feature parity, floating diacritics, and common symbols & punctuation.

Here is the review from my happy client:

Here is a screenshot of the two font files overlaid:

### Dragonia typeface

I created three variants of a typeface in the style of a dragon claw scratching letters, based on the modern human Latin alphabet. The typfaces are for use in a future world based on medi√¶val civilisation, in which dragons and humans co-exist and live under dragonlaw.&#x20;

The typefaces are thus:&#x20;

1. Claw form, scratched by claw into rock, bark, metal, etc.
2. Quill form, a refined version written with a feather-tip or metal-tip quill, used by royalty and the likes.
3. Claw-quill form, written with a claw-nib quill, by the serfs and non-humans who cannot afford a fancy quill.

He put in a lot of effort and passion into his work and created the font I was looking for and envisioned for my fantasy world. He created it perfectly to what I had in mind, and from the sketches he showed me, and I highly recommend hiring him for any work regarding font creation. 10/10!"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
