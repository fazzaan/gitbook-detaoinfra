### Speak Now ebooks **Nói Bây giờ**

I wrote these ebooks with my good friend AM English. She and I are both professional English teachers, with extensive experience teaching English in Viet Nam. She is native Vietnamese and has perfect English from living & studying in the US for 4 years. I am native British English and can speak basic Vietnamese, from living and teaching in Viet Nam for 5 years! Please check out these ebooks that we made with love and care, because we are both passionate about communication and helping other people like us to fulfil their dreams of travelling the world and landing jobs that require interaction with foreigners!

### IPA but accurate / IPA **nhưng Chính xác**

I wrote this book based on the CUBE analysis of modern British English. It goes deeper than just British English, recognising that the standardised IPA rendering of English is vastly inaccurate and is the primary cause of the majority of English learners' pronunciation mistakes.&#x20;
