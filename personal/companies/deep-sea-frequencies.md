# ðŸª¼ Deep Sea Frequencies

_Deep Sea Frequencies_, previously known as _Psychedelic Jelly_, is a non-profit music event & record label based in Bristol in the UK. We started way back in 2017 as a music event only, seeking to fill the gap in the music scene for downtempo psychedelic dub music. Since then, we have grown and evolved both in musical genres and in function.&#x20;

<summary>Renaming</summary>

In 2025 we were forced to rename our organisation due to the rise of AI-moderated social media networks, which resulted in the word "psychedelic" being banned in many cases. Our pages on Facebook and Instagram were permanently banned for no reason other than this, so we had to undertake a full rebrand.

Nowadays, _Deep Sea Frequencies_ also operates as a record label and manages artists for stage "takeovers" at some events and festivals. We release music from a broader range of styles too, including bass, dub, drum & bass, and more, but all these styles are heavily fused with psychedelic flavours. We also commission visual artists to create art for album covers, and for decoration at our events.

All money generated goes back to our musicians and artists, some to charity, and to cover the operational expenses of the organisation.
