## [farranddroid-tech.md](farranddroid-tech.md "mention")

_FarrAndDroid Tech_ is my first company, which I started during school as a tech support business. Despite only taking a few paid clients, I helped a lot of friends, family and mutual connections with their technological woes, spanning Windows, Linux, Android and MacOS.&#x20;

## [phlowyd-design.md](phlowyd-design.md "mention")

_Phlowyd Design_ gradually grew out of my artistic endeavours, as I'm quite technical in my approach to things yet still love to do art and express my imagination through it. I've been doing visual design projects for well over 12 years now, although the the lavish application of colour and atypical layout may be cause for many graphic design purists to try to wrest the title of "graphic designer" from me. I've been working professionally since 2017 and I have several regular clients alongside my gig-work clients.

I got into font design in 2019 and have been making typefaces ever since. Designing typefaces is somewhat more time consuming than designing imagery like event flyers, so this has been a slower process but, between 2019 and 2025, I have produced 14 typefaces, each with a substantially different underlying concept.

## [deep-sea-frequencies.md](deep-sea-frequencies.md "mention")

_Deep Sea Frequencies_, previously known as _Psychedelic Jelly_, is a non-profit music event & record label based in Bristol in the UK. We started way back in 2017 as a music event only, seeking to fill the gap in the music scene for downtempo psychedelic dub music. Since then, we have grown and evolved both in musical genres and in function.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Renaming</summary>

In 2025 we were forced to rename our organisation due to the rise of AI-moderated social media networks, which resulted in the word "psychedelic" being banned in many cases. Our pages on Facebook and Instagram were permanently banned for no reason other than this, so we had to undertake a full rebrand.

</details>

Nowadays, _Deep Sea Frequencies_ also operates as a record label and manages artists for stage "takeovers" at some events and festivals. We release music from a broader range of styles too, including bass, dub, drum & bass, and more, but all these styles are heavily fused with psychedelic flavours. We also commission visual artists to create art for album covers, and for decoration at our events.

All money generated goes back to our musicians and artists, some to charity, and to cover the operational expenses of the organisation.

## [deltastep-english.md](deltastep-english.md "mention")

This is my latest company, started in 2023 (or 2022?) as an English education company. As an English teacher teaching in Viet Nam and online, I encounter a multitude of frustrations with both the common teaching methods and with the educational resources. I've been teaching for more than 5 years now and, as such, have developed my own methods and materials. However, I would love to share these with students and other teachers, so I've started publishing my materials under the name _DeltaStep English_.&#x20;

Once I have enough materials and a complete curriculum of the basics of English, and a small team, we will incorporate and start running courses online. Our roadmap includes founding a physical language centre too â€” there are many of these already, but in my experience so far, it seems that most follow the same ideas, the same concepts, the same patterns, and that _these ways are not very effective_. My ideas are fundamentally based upon play-like learning, with a child-like modality for developing stability in communication. We do not focus on efficiency but on confidence, understanding & stability.
