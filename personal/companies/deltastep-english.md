# DeltaStep English

This is my latest company, started in 2023 (or 2022?) as an English education company. As an English teacher teaching in Viet Nam and online, I encounter a multitude of frustrations with both the common teaching methods and with the educational resources. I've been teaching for more than 5 years now and, as such, have developed my own methods and materials. However, I would love to share these with students and other teachers, so I've started publishing my materials under the name _DeltaStep English_.&#x20;

Once I have enough materials and a complete curriculum of the basics of English, and a small team, we will incorporate and start running courses online. Our roadmap includes founding a physical language centre too â€” there are many of these already, but in my experience so far, it seems that most follow the same ideas, the same concepts, the same patterns, and that _these ways are not very effective_. My ideas are fundamentally based upon play-like learning, with a child-like modality for developing stability in communication. We do not focus on efficiency but on confidence, understanding & stability.
