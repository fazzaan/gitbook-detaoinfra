# üìê Phlowyd Design

_Phlowyd Design_ gradually grew out of my artistic endeavours, as I'm quite technical in my approach to things yet still love to do art and express my imagination through it. I've been doing visual design projects for well over 12 years now, although the the lavish application of colour and atypical layout may be cause for many graphic design purists to try to wrest the title of "graphic designer" from me. I've been working professionally since 2017 and I have several regular clients alongside my gig-work clients.

I got into font design in 2019 and have been making typefaces ever since. Designing typefaces is somewhat more time consuming than designing imagery like event flyers, so this has been a slower process but, between 2019 and 2025, I have produced 14 typefaces, each with a substantially different underlying concept.
