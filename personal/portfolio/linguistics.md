# Linguistics

My forays into font design eventually led me to looking for new ways to represent English. Never did I focus on æsthetics, but rather on exploring unusual representations of form and shape, attempting to push the boundaries of how readers perceive shapes and render them into letters.

One thing led to another and suddenly I'm creating a whole new alphabet for English — not once, not twice, but at least 5 times, until I finally arrived at the (still-evolving) beast that I've dubbed _<mark style="color:yellow;">NewEng</mark>_.&#x20;

I expect this project to keep evolving, as some elements of it are totally stable while others are still in flux, somewhat unavoidably. I am happy with the stable elements and they fulfill my intentions perfectly.&#x20;

The unstable elements may take more iterations to reach maturity, or may never settle without some additional layers of evolution in the orthography.&#x20;

It strikes me that perhaps a fully-linear script is not ideal for representing the complexities of English's phonological mutations in speech combined with its grammatical morphology, but it is hard to deviate when linear script — and without diacritics — looks so clean and gentle on the eyes.&#x20;

It is a phonemic alphabet with a many-to-one relationship between letters and phonemes, thus it can be used to accurately maintain etymological history whilst not creating any confusions as to how to pronounce a letter.

You can explore _NewEng_ on the dedicated website:
