description: Fire & LED play & performance with poi and contact staff

# ü§π Flow arts

I do poi and contact staff, and dabble in contact juggling and juggling.

I do them on fire and also on plastic. I used to do LED too but some kind soul really needed them at a party that I put on so they took them and now they're somewhere that I am not.

I have surprisingly few vides of myself actually doing any of these things.

It's unreasonably difficult to get anyone to video me, and even harder to acquire the video afterwards, _especially_ in the original format. Everyone just sends things via WhatsApp or Facebook and then deletes the original file. This is NOT how you help someone record their performances!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please, if you see me playing with any kind of flow arts, _especially with fire_, **PLEASE DO** take videos and **PLEASE DO** send it to me afterwards.

_Send the original file. Do not compress it or send it over rubbishy messenger platforms._

_If the video is stable and the lighting is good, I will even pay you for it._

{% endhint %}

I do have a few videos in my Google Photos library. I'll dig through soon, edit them a bit and put some up on YouTube.
