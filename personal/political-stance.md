# Political stance

It would be nice to be a-political, quiet, peaceful, not take sides, etc, blah blah, all that bullshit,

right?

The world is political.

If politics "isn't affecting you", that's because you are in the privileged class.

So if you have been able to make the decision to stay out of politics, that's because of your privilege.

That means that you do not care about other human beings.

Because, guess what will happen when the political construct changes, and you are no longer privileged?

You will care.

A lot.

I'm not condoning or inciting war.

In fact, if everyone were politically conscious, awake and active, war would rarely — if ever — be necessary.

The dominating personalities will always, _always_ rise to try to dominate the rest of us.

It is our solemn duty as humans to protect each other and everything around us.

The dominating personalities are predators, and the only thing that can stop them is communal solidarity.



Free Palestine

Free Sudan

Free the Congo

Free Yemen

Free the European group from colonialist predators and the rest of the world shall be free.



Is it that simple?

Not really, but European colonialism is to blame for the _**vast majority of Ærþ's problems**_.



## #LANDBACK&#x20;

All dominating, predatory colony states must be returned to the native peoples.

Unfortunately, too many native peoples have been irreparably damaged by the invaders.

Careful transitionary processes must be constructed, so as to hand power back to the native peoples.

With all the necessary decolonialisation, education and organisation required, this may take years to decades to even generations.

That is fine.

It must start.



You should take a stance in politics.

If you don't know enough, learn.



The world has enough apathists.
